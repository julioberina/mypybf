Brainfuck interpreter commands

There are eight commands:
+ : Increments the value at the current cell by one.
- : Decrements the value at the current cell by one.
> : Moves the data pointer to the next cell (cell on the right).
< : Moves the data pointer to the previous cell (cell on the left).
. : Prints the ASCII value at the current cell (i.e. 65 = 'A').
, : Reads a single input character into the current cell.
[ : If the value at the current cell is zero, skips to the corresponding ] .
    Otherwise, move to the next instruction.
] : If the value at the current cell is zero, move to the next instruction.
    Otherwise, move backwards in the instructions to the corresponding [ .

[ and ] form a while loop. Obviously, they must be balanced.
