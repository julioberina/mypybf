# mypybf
brainfuck interpreter written in Python 3

This is not a REPL!  This is an interpreter than runs brainfuck files.

To run a brainfuck program (.bf file) run the following command:
`python3 interpreter.py FILE_NAME.bf`

A Ruby script (rbbf.rb) is included which converts .txt files to brainfuck code

To convert any .txt file to brainfuck code, run the following command:
`ruby rbbf.rb FILE_NAME.txt`

Then, a brainfuck file of the same name will be generated.
